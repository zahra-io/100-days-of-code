# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

## Goal:
— To finish the freeCodeCamp **Front End Development Certificate** and **The Web Developer Bootcamp** by the end of #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

### Day 1: April 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I've finished 10 Basic HTML exercises on freeCodeCamp. I listened to 2 episodes of @2ndcareerdevs podcast. I watched "Introduction to Web Development Fundamentals" from Lambda Precourse work. Lastly, I played around with terminal commands — attempting to push this onto github and I definitely forgot how to do it so it was good practice. I need to keep doing it to retain memory.

**Thoughts:** This was all beginners material that refreshed my memory. I'm good at HTML but since I haven't touched it in a year, I definitely needed the refresher on element tags. I learned the difference between Front End and Back End development and some unique challenges a Software Engineer may experience, which challenged my thought process because I never thought about creating accessible products for people who are color blind/may have hearing issues. Overall, I'm feeling good! I struggled with focus a bit but I got through it and the @2ndcareerdevs podcast gave me a hint of motivation to start learning.

### Day 2: April 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I finished 17 Basic HTML lessons on freeCodeCamp — meaning I finished the Basic HTML section of freeCodeCamp. Watched Lambda Schools tutorials on Introduction to HTML, which complemented the other lessons.

**Thoughts:** Got confused about `radio` buttons! So you add a `label` tag and then add a `for` tag to make the syntax clear to the programmer. And then you have to name all of them the same `name` so that they are grouped as one. The explanation was a little confusing but I eventually got it.

### Day 3: April 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I listened to @CodeNewbies S1E8: "What and why is web animation" and S2E6: "Who decides the future of CSS (Jen Simmons)." Followed by that I watched the "Introduction to CSS videos by Lambda School and completed 3 challenges/quizzes on Codepen that tested the knowledge I learned so far and then I worked through the Basic CSS section of @freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good! I'm trying not to miss days but I've accepted that it's going to happen sometimes as long as I stay committed to code consistently. I like CSS because it's creative and visual. I learned
through the podcasts that CSS animation isn't a career, however, CSS skills—especially animation—can complement a front-end developer. I want to get as comfortable as possible with CSS so I'm going to spend a little bit more time with it and create projects purely with CSS.
