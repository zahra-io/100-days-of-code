# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent an hour working through HTML Syntax of Grow with Google Challenge Front End Development track. It's a great refresher to HTML. I was always curious about what ```<meta charset="UTF-8">``` meant but was too lazy to research it in the past so now I know!

**Thoughts:** The course is really well done so far. I like it. It's engaging with a combination of quizzes and videos. I'm excited to keep learning! I went through an ultimate low with motivation but I think I'm back at it. Definitely going to push through this time.

### Day 2: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the HTML Syntax Problem Set and Mockup to Article Project for Grow with Google on Udacity. The Mockup to Article Project was a little difficult because I don't remember a lot of the HTML I learned in the past so it was nice to refresh my memory!

**Thoughts:** I learned how to write image links stored locally. I never knew how to do that before so there's always something new to learn. I'm liking this course a lot. It's really engaging.

### Day 3: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the CSS Syntax lesson on Grow with Google Udacity Course. Learned how to use Developer Tools in different browsers, especially chrome to tweak around websites.

**Thoughts:** I liked this one because I actually really like CSS. The small quizzes are extremely helpful in reiterating the material.

### Day 4: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked through the 2 hour CSS Problem Set for Grow With Google on Udacity. I'm really getting into the course! I learned about CSS selectors and refreshed my memory on attributes.

**Thoughts:** This was challenging! I like that the course makes you use Developer Tools to solve some of the problem sets because that's how real world programming works. This course is REALLY challenging my intellect and I like that the problems are approached in a different way than I've learned before. I also enjoy the community, they're really helpful and prompt with feedback!

### Day 5: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through "How To Write Code Faster" on Udacity. So I'm a little slow with shortcuts because it's hard to remember all of them so I think that I'm going to have to go through this exercise a few times. I really like the timed quiz though.

**Thoughts:** I thought THIS was challenging. Really pushed me to learn the shortcuts by doing the "timed" challenge. I don't remember all of them but I know a lot of them from basic usage of Atom. I liked this lesson a lot!

### Day 6: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Animal Trading Card Project on Udacity Grow With Google Course. I've never used CSS without hand-holding so it's a little tough! I wrote out the basic layout for what I was going to do and named my HTML tags with class attributes. I styled it a little bit as well but I'm sleepy now so I'll work on the rest of it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to see how this will turn out and how I can challenge myself to use properties I've never used before! I understand now why people find CSS intimidating. There's SO many different styles you can use.


### Day 7: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Animal Trading Card Project. It looks simple because I'm not sure where to look for certain style options or how to utilize them. But I've submitted it for feedback and definitely going to return to this project to add more later on! [link](https://codepen.io/zahra-io/pen/WdYoqy)

**Thoughts:** I realized that I don't know how to properly use the ```padding``` and ```margin``` properties in CSS. The numbers confuse me because I'm generally bad with numbers but also...how do you know where to start?! Is it ```5px```? Is it ```10px 10px 10px 10px```? I'm sure I'll figure it out. Time to google it.
