# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent an hour working through HTML Syntax of Grow with Google Challenge Front End Development track. It's a great refresher to HTML. I was always curious about what ```<meta charset="UTF-8">``` meant but was too lazy to research it in the past so now I know!

**Thoughts:** The course is really well done so far. I like it. It's engaging with a combination of quizzes and videos. I'm excited to keep learning! I went through an ultimate low with motivation but I think I'm back at it. Definitely going to push through this time.

### Day 2: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the HTML Syntax Problem Set and Mockup to Article Project for Grow with Google on Udacity. The Mockup to Article Project was a little difficult because I don't remember a lot of the HTML I learned in the past so it was nice to refresh my memory!

**Thoughts:** I learned how to write image links stored locally. I never knew how to do that before so there's always something new to learn. I'm liking this course a lot. It's really engaging.

### Day 3: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the CSS Syntax lesson on Grow with Google Udacity Course. Learned how to use Developer Tools in different browsers, especially chrome to tweak around websites.

**Thoughts:** I liked this one because I actually really like CSS. The small quizzes are extremely helpful in reiterating the material.

### Day 4: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked through the 2 hour CSS Problem Set for Grow With Google on Udacity. I'm really getting into the course! I learned about CSS selectors and refreshed my memory on attributes.

**Thoughts:** This was challenging! I like that the course makes you use Developer Tools to solve some of the problem sets because that's how real world programming works. This course is REALLY challenging my intellect and I like that the problems are approached in a different way than I've learned before. I also enjoy the community, they're really helpful and prompt with feedback!

### Day 5: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through "How To Write Code Faster" on Udacity. So I'm a little slow with shortcuts because it's hard to remember all of them so I think that I'm going to have to go through this exercise a few times. I really like the timed quiz though.

**Thoughts:** I thought THIS was challenging. Really pushed me to learn the shortcuts by doing the "timed" challenge. I don't remember all of them but I know a lot of them from basic usage of Atom. I liked this lesson a lot!

### Day 6: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Animal Trading Card Project on Udacity Grow With Google Course. I've never used CSS without hand-holding so it's a little tough! I wrote out the basic layout for what I was going to do and named my HTML tags with class attributes. I styled it a little bit as well but I'm sleepy now so I'll work on the rest of it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to see how this will turn out and how I can challenge myself to use properties I've never used before! I understand now why people find CSS intimidating. There's SO many different styles you can use.

### Day 7: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Animal Trading Card Project. It looks simple because I'm not sure where to look for certain style options or how to utilize them. But I've submitted it for feedback and definitely going to return to this project to add more later on! [Clicky Click to see my project!](https://codepen.io/zahra-io/pen/WdYoqy)

**Thoughts:** I realized that I don't know how to properly use the ```padding``` and ```margin``` properties in CSS. The numbers confuse me because I'm generally bad with numbers but also...how do you know where to start?! Is it ```5px```? Is it ```10px 10px 10px 10px```? I'm sure I'll figure it out. Time to google it.

### Day 8: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent an hour working through the "What is JavaScript?" section of Grow With Google Course on Udacity. Also read an article on the difference between classes and ID's in HTML/CSS and when to use each of them. I never know when NOT to use ID's so the article was a great breakdown of that.

**Thoughts:** I liked it. I learned about the history of JavaScript and how to use Developer Tools to write/test JavaScript in console. Feeling good about ID's and classes and will definitely apply some of the tips for future projects.

### Day 9: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed Data Types & Variables on Grow With Google. This was a REALLY great refresher on the topic because I definitely forgot some of the rules I learned.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited! Concatenating a string got confusing for me by adding a bunch of ```+```'s but I think with more practice I'll get it.

### Day 10: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent 1 hour working through the Conditionals lesson on Grow With Google. I got through half of the course and then got stuck on the Murder Mystery problem.

**Thoughts:** It was challenging! I didn't know how to verify if my conditional was true or false so it took me a bit to figure it out. I asked the Slack community for help and then understood what I was missing.

### Day 11: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Conditionals section of Grow with Google! A few of the quizzes were tough because I didn't understand the logic. I've always had a difficult time with logic in general but some of these were hard! I had a difficult time with the Ice Cream Quiz and Ternary Operators. I didn't know that ```if...else``` statements could be written in a single ```if``` statement so I got stuck on the syntax. And then Ternary operators are weird for me to understand so I definitely have to read up on them more and practice using them.

**Thoughts:** I'm still enjoying coding. I had a difficult time focusing this weekend but I realized that instead of striving to complete a WHOLE lesson in one or two days (or a couple hours) I should stick to ONE HOUR of coding so that I don't get discouraged because some problems take longer than others to solve.

### Day 12: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the loops section and completed 4 lessons. I've done the "FizzBuzz" code a couple of times already, especially in technical interviews and thought this one was interesting because it was called "JuliaJames" instead.

**Thoughts:** I feel good! It took me a little while to figure out this problem (even though I've done it multiple times) but I always forget that if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, I should put this in an ```if``` statement from the start instead of adding it at the bottom. My solution was this:

```
var x = 1;

while (x <= 20) {
    if (x % 3 === 0 && x % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("JuliaJames");
    } else if (x % 3 === 0) {
        console.log("Julia");
    } else if (x % 5 ===0) {
        console.log("James");
    } else {
        console.log(x)
    }
    x += 1
}
```

### Day 13: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I coded for an hour. My focus today was on the "99 Bottles of Juice" Quiz for Grow With Google on Udacity using a ```while loop```. I like using them because I understand them better than the ```for loop``` but THIS PROBLEM WAS SO TOUGH. I got tripped up printing the different pluralization of words when it prints ```1 bottle of juice``` instead of ```2 bottles of juice``` so I had a difficult time switching the statement. But I figured it out!

**Thoughts:** Struggled! But it was interesting because I liked the challenge. Sometimes, I'm the type of gal who gets discouraged and gives up because I believe myself into thinking that I can't do it. But I couldn't figure out this problem, which MADE me want to figure it out even more. Bring it on Grow With Google!

### Day 14: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked on a Countdown, Liftoff! Quiz for Grow With Google. I really liked this one. I struggled with it at first because I kept getting syntax errors but it was a bunch of ```if...else``` statements and knowing where to print a string.  

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot about using ```while loops``` without having much hand holding. I liked this problem a lot and learned to break it down into smaller steps and try small bits of code first before diving into trying to solve the entire thing. I usually just jump to consoles and get a bunch of shitty code so this was a great exercise.

### Day 15: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Coded for 30 minutes. Just tutorials on ```for loops```, learning to decrement and increment a loop, and learned about nested loops. Those are goddamn trippy.

**Thoughts:** Nested ```loops``` are weird and I know I'm going to get confused with this but I'm still liking coding and I learned a lot throughout these tutorials.

### Day 16: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Coded for 30 minutes today. I worked on some quizzes for Grow With Google. I learned to change a ```while loop``` into a ```for loop```, fix errors in a ```loop``` such as semicolons, paying attention to start conditions, stop conditions, and next step condition.

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking that I need to do more exercises on loops to understand them fully. I understand them and how to implement them but once problems get more complicated, I get confused.

### Day 17: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Coded for an hour. Worked on the Factorials Quiz and the Find My Seat Quiz. Factorials ARE HARD. I never understood them from math class anyway, I don't understand them in code.

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking that I should probably take up some basic algebra lessons on Khan Academy because my skills are REALLY weak. I always struggled with math in school and I think it's because I was always bad at learning in a classroom vs. learning on my own and if I stayed on top of it at home, I would've understood it. But I didn't do that so my math skills are WEAK.
