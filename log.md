# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Frontend Masters Introduction to Web Development Course. Spent two hours watching the lectures and finished the HTML lectures. It was a great refresher to JavaScript basics.

**Thoughts:** Good! I haven't touched programming in a long time + it's always nice to refresh your memory of everything. I think at this point, my knowledge is pretty good in HTML and CSS, but there's always something new I can learn.

### Day 2: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed an hour of the CSS section of Introduction to Web Development. I love CSS, it's creative and challenging and there's so much you can do with it.

**Thoughts:** I know how to use CSS and I'm aware of the rules but I really liked how the instructor explained it. He taught the VERY basic of CSS, which I haven't been able to get in some of the tutorials I've seen. So this was a nice refresher too and helped me understand some concepts differently.
