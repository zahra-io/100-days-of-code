# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

## Goal:
— To finish the freeCodeCamp **Front End Development Certificate** and **The Web Developer Bootcamp** by the end of #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

### Day 1: April 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I've finished 10 Basic HTML exercises on freeCodeCamp. I listened to 2 episodes of @2ndcareerdevs podcast. I watched "Introduction to Web Development Fundamentals" from Lambda Precourse work. Lastly, I played around with terminal commands — attempting to push this onto github and I definitely forgot how to do it so it was good practice. I need to keep doing it to retain memory.

**Thoughts:** This was all beginners material that refreshed my memory. I'm good at HTML but since I haven't touched in a year, I definitely needed the refresher on element tags. I learned the difference between Front End and Back End development and some unique challenges a Software Engineer may run into. I'm feeling good! I struggled with focus a bit but I got through it and the @2ndcareerdevs podcast gave me a hint of motivation to start learning.
