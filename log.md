# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Watched 2 hours of Front-End Masters Introduction to Web Development.

**Thoughts:** It was a nice refresher, especially since I haven't touched code in SO long.

### Day 2: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Watched an hour of the CSS section of the lecture on Front End Masters.

**Thoughts:** I like the instructor. The course is a little too basic for me but it's always nice to have the concepts explained differently.

### Day 3: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Watched an hour of the Introduction to JavaScript on Front End Masters. It's SUCH a great course! I read chapter 1 of YDKJS and started Flexbox Zombies.

**Thoughts:** Chapter 1 of YDKJS is really well written and the Front End Masters lesson was a nice touch to the text. I LOVE Flexbox Zombies. Interactive courses are such a great way to learn these things.

### Day 4: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Introduction to JavaScript on Front End Masters and Chapter 1 of YDKJS. Continued working on Flexbox Zombies.

**Thoughts:** I'm addicted to Flexbox Zombies. I'm on chapter 3, so I've learned to use ```flex-direction```, ```justify-content```, and ```align-items```. It's so much fun.

### Day 5: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 4 of Flexbox Zombies. I learned about ```align-self```.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get a lot of coding in except chapter 4 of Flexbox Zombies. I've decided to not be super harsh with myself if I don't get an hour in of coding because it's better to do 10-30 minutes a day instead of nothing at all. I like that Flexbox Zombies reviews the cumulative lessons at the end of each chapter so you get to use ALL the skills you've learned so far!

### Day 6: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I played around with the Google Doodle! It's SO cute. The little rabbit hops and collects carrots as you put together logic puzzles. I completed Chapter 5 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```flex-grow```.

**Thoughts:** These visual games have become super challenging for me to use as a way of understanding concepts. I used to be such a visual person but I think I understand things more when writing actual code? I don't even know! These puzzle blocks were fun though.

### Day 7: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 6 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```flex-shrink```.

**Thoughts:** These challenges are getting harder! ```flex-shrink``` and ```flex-grow``` are a little hard for me because I don't think I fully understand how they work?

### Day 8: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```flex-basis```.

**Thoughts:** With numbers, what confuses me is that I never know how many ```px``` each rule needs to use. It trips me up. Do you just eye the content and figure it out that way? Is there actual math involved? How do you utilize rules with numbers?!

### Day 9: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 8 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```order```.

**Thoughts:** So I get it, this rule fixes the order of the content. I understand it in terms of the zombie game and I can't visualize it in terms of a web application.

### Day 10: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I went back to Chapter 5 and 6 of Flexbox Zombies to review ```flex-grow``` and ```flex-shrink```. I also looked these rules up on MDN.

**Thoughts:** ```flex-shrink``` is used to shrink items to fill the container according to the ```flex-shrink``` number. I'm bad with numbers so I played the guessing game on that one. Is it shrinking by 1? Is it shrinking by 2? I don't know. Trail and error guys! I wish there was a better explanation. ```flex-grow``` specifies the amount of space inside the flex container that the item should take up.

### Day 11: December 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Played Flexbox Zombies Chapter 7 + 8 ```flex-basis``` and ```order``` again to try to understand these rules.

**Thoughts:** ```flex-basis``` is going to take me a little while to understand. I definitely have to play around with it more. ```order``` is easy to understand because items in the same container are in ascending order. It's hard to explain it but I understand now.

### Day 12: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 9 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```flex-wrap```.

**Thoughts:** I liked this one! It wraps items into one single line or multiple lines and makes them look pretty.

### Day 13: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 10 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```align-content```.

**Thoughts:** This was similar to ```align-items``` and ```align-self```. I liked it because it helps you fix the space between and around the content along the cross-axis of their container. I can't wait to use these in an actual web application.

### Day 14: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 11 of Flexbox Zombies and learned about ```flex``` and ```flex-flow```.

**Thoughts:** ```flex``` makes things a lot easier instead of typing out ```flex-shrink```, ```flex-grow```, and ```flex-basis``` but it's also a little confusing when an item isn't growing or shrinking.

### Day 15: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Flexbox Zombies! Learned about how to use all the rules in one zombie challenge. That was awesome.

**Thoughts:** The last challenging was definitely hard. I didn't know that I had to set the ```crossbow``` to ```flex-shrink: 0;``` AND the last zombie to ```flex-shrink: 0;``` because it looked like they WERE shrinking. The grid and the movements of the items are confusing. I'm definitely going to do round 2 of this when needed. It was a nice introduction to flexbox.

### Day 16: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started CS50 again. I rewatched about 30 minutes of the Week 0 lecture for CS50. I learned about binary 0's and 1's which was super cool!

**Thoughts:** These lectures are LONG. I definitely have to split them up into smaller time frames because my focus is NOT that great. But I thought that it was awesome learning about how binary numbers work and how to convert actual human numbers into 0's and 1's. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.

### Day 17: December 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Watched the rest of Week 0 lecture on CS50. I think the instructor is great and explains things really well.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited! I liked how he explained the process of finding a name in a phone book. It's like understanding code using a real-life problem which I think is cool. I know algorithms are going to be hard for me because I'm not good at math but I'm sure if I focus, I can learn it.

### Day 18: December 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Played around with Scratch for a little bit and chose my Sprites. My game is going to be called "Drunk Elephant" where my elephant eats Doughnuts and Hearts but dies when it eats a mice. It's inspired by Super Mario Bros.

**Thoughts:** I think the best way to learn is to copy something you like doing until you get good enough to create your own game. Scratch is a lot harder than I thought and I wish I was exposed to a game like this when I was younger. Such a great tool for learning.

### Day 19: December 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spent an hour watching Youtube videos on how to make sprites fall from the sky in Scratch. So I completely forgot that this game works on a X and Y axis. lol!!! But I figured out how to make the doughnut fall from the sky and disappear when it touches the elephant.

**Thoughts:** I struggled! I have to find a way to make my little doughnut to disappear when it touches the ground and for the elephant to be more interactive. It's one thing at a time, thats all that matters. I also have to fix the score keeper.

### Day 20: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a teeny bit progress in Scratch. I wanted to work on making my elephant move left and right and jump up and down. I watched some YouTube videos on it and experimented with a few things.

**Thoughts:** This is hard! I made it move left and right but I couldn't get it to jump.

### Day 21: December 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on making my elephant sprite jump up and down and move left and right at the same time. I looked at someone else's game to try out what they did. It worked!

**Thoughts:** Scratch is definitely hard. I'm going to watch a video tutorial on how to actually program in Scratch because it's confusing. But I made it work! I'm going to make my doughnuts bounce instead of falling from the sky so that they are everywhere.

### Day 22: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on my Scratch project. I added gravity to my elephant so that it comes right down when it jumps. I also figured out a way to hide the doughnuts!

**Thoughts:** It's challenging! I feel like I have to google and watch a lot of YouTube videos to make certain functions work. I'm going to play around with it more tomorrow.

### Day 23: December 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I'm known for changing things up last minute. SO I changed my Scratch game to be more festive. My sprites are a Fat Santa, a monster, and two present sprites. I used the same concepts.

**Thoughts:** It's a little hard for me to grasp visual logic for some reason but I'm feeling ok! My Santa sprite is functioning and is moving left and right and jumps up when I press the up-arrow key.

### Day 24: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on my Santa game. I spent a long time fixing up my custom sprites instead of adding logic to them. But I have everything all set up now. I have to add the logic for everything.

**Thoughts:** My motivation was a bit low today because I was tired from work but I can't wait to see my game come to life!

### Day 25: December 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I added all the logic. My Santa Claus jumps up when the up-arrow key is pressed. It moves left when the left key is pressed and moves right when the right key is pressed. I added sound effects and then I added sensing and events. The operators confuses me a bit in Scratch so I had to do a little research.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok! Scratch is NOT easy but it was fun building the game. It was all about trail and error and watching TONS of youtube videos to figure out what I was doing. Here is the link to the project:
