###### Started a clean slate for everything. I created a new Github account, a new account on Flatiron's Learn.co website, I'm starting over with my 100-days-of-code log because I felt that I needed to organize everything and create a new curriculum. I started Learn.co back in January when I FIRST started coding so the labs were already done and when I tried to re-do them, it got confusing. I have a better idea of what I'm doing and why I'm learning to code so here's to reaching goals!

### Day 1: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've finished 12 JavaScript exercises and readings on Bootcamp Prep. I'm 25% into the course.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good! I reviewed HTML/CSS and DOM Selectors. I think I need to do a bit more reading on CSS Selectors because there's SOOO many. But I'm feeling good.
