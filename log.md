# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent an hour working through HTML Syntax of Grow with Google Challenge Front End Development track. It's a great refresher to HTML. I was always curious about what ```<meta charset="UTF-8">``` meant but was too lazy to research it in the past so now I know!

**Thoughts:** The course is really well done so far. I like it. It's engaging with a combination of quizzes and videos. I'm excited to keep learning! I went through an ultimate low with motivation but I think I'm back at it. Definitely going to push through this time.
