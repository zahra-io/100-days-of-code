# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: November 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No coding but I watched an hour of CS50 on edX of week 0.

**Thoughts** This introductory course to Computer Science is so interesting. The instructor introduced a lot of topics but we're starting the first lecture/week off with Scratch. I'm SO excited. I didn't get through the entire lecture, but I'm going to continue watching the rest of it tomorrow.

### Day 2: November 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched the rest of CS50 week 0 and made an account on Scratch. I also viewed some of the projects previous students have done and thought that was cool!

**Thoughts**: I'm excited! I'm going to start building my Scratch game tomorrow.

### Day 3: November 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I familiarized myself with some of the scripts, costumes, and sounds Scratch can do. I chose my sprites and the overall layout of the game I'm going to build.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling good! I think it's going to be slightly difficult but I really want to spend time on this, learning the logic and understanding how things work. I like that Scratch is so visual. Super cool.

### Day 4: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour. I started building my game on Scratch. I chose a colorful Unicorn themed game. I think the Unicorn is going to eat the rainbow but avoid the bugs. I thought about Super Mario game and how they used to be my favorite games when I was younger so I wanted to replicate that!

**Thoughts**: Surprisingly it was tough! The first step is to add movement to my main sprite (the Unicorn) so that it works. I didn't know how to make it move left and right so after playing around with some of the scripts, I googled a little bit and figured it out. I also added a fairydust sound to the game. I think it's fun!
