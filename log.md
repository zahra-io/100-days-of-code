# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

## I'm using this as a form of blogging and thought process reflection while I learn Software Engineering / Web Development / Computer Science. Although I've continuously coded everyday, I lost track of my logs—and I enjoy logging because it gives me an outlet to reflect on what I learned. But through trial and error, I've created a more structured system for my learning style. I don't want to JUST learn web development, I want to learn the root of it. It's how my brain works. Instead of being harsh on myself, I'm going to say that throughout the past year, I've gotten better at programming. I know things now that I absolutely didn't know before. I'm starting this log from day one, and this time it's NOT because I missed a few days or I learned something and quit, but because I want to keep organized with my logging so my thoughts are clear. Some people will use a blog to reflect, I'm going to use this file to be verbose and rant away my journey.

### Day 1: February 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I spent about an hour on Khan Academy learning Algebra 1. I was never great at math because I never tried to learn it but I can see how it's relevant in Computer Science and Web Development. Might as well start from the root, right?

**Thoughts:** Whenever there's a problem in JavaScript that involves, I immediately shy away from it and don't feel like solving it because math has always been my biggest weakness. It could be a simple problem but because programming is hard for me, math makes it seem more difficult. So I decided that I'd spend 30 minutes to an hour every day practicing math. Today was pretty good—I actually had fun learning some Algebra concepts that confused the fuck out of me in high school and college. So yay for that!
