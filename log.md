# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

##### I'm using this as a form of blogging and thought process reflection while I learn Software Engineering / Web Development / Computer Science. Although I've continuously coded everyday, I lost track of my logs—and I enjoy logging because it gives me an outlet to reflect on what I learned. But through trial and error, I've created a more structured system for my learning style. I don't want to JUST learn web development, I want to learn the root of it. It's how my brain works. Instead of being harsh on myself, I'm going to say that throughout the past year, I've gotten better at programming. I know things now that I absolutely didn't know before. I'm starting this log from day one, and this time it's NOT because I missed a few days or I learned something and quit, but because I want to keep organized with my logging so my thoughts are clear. Some people will use a blog to reflect, I'm going to use this file to be verbose and rant away my journey.

### Day 1: February 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I spent about an hour on Khan Academy learning Algebra 1. I was never great at math because I never tried to learn it but I can see how it's relevant in Computer Science and Web Development. Might as well start from the root, right?

**Thoughts:** Whenever there's a problem in JavaScript that involves a math problem, I immediately shy away from it and don't feel like solving it because math has always been my biggest weakness. It could be a simple problem but because programming is hard for me, math makes it seem more difficult. So I decided that I'd spend 30 minutes to an hour every day practicing math. Today was pretty good—I actually had fun learning some Algebra concepts that confused the fuck out of me in high school and college. So yay for that!

### Day 2: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Skipped yesterday because of work-related things that got in the way. I watched and followed along a Pure CSS Image and Animation tutorial. We created a Koala! I tweaked the Koala to my own liking and played around with the color palette. Choosing colours is my favourite part of any project.

**Thoughts:** I think it's pretty cool that you can nest a ```div``` tag inside of another ```div``` tag for CSS images and it'll create one shape for that div (if this makes sense). I didn't understand how percentages worked, but doing this image tutorial helped me make a lot of sense of some of the CSS properties. I learned about ```z-index```, which I think is great. I understood it in the way a desigenr would with Photoshop layers. So to put the ears behind the Koala's head, the ```z-index``` was necessary. However, I've definitely seen images and animations that have taken a different approach so I'm going to look into that. My goal with my Koala is to make it blink!

### Day 3: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Picking up my lesson from where I left off even though I skipped a few days. I know, I know — if other people can make time everyday with a full-time job, so can I. And I'm getting into it! So today, I worked through a few lessons on Pure CSS Images. I learned more in-depth about ```z-index```. I really found the CSS Variables used for SCSS really cool. They're so efficient and I never such a thing existed but they're so simple to use. I finally learned about the ```@keyframe``` property which adds the animation so I tinkered around with my Koala and made him blink!

Even though it's such a simple thing, it's exciting for me because I'm a visual person and I LOVE aesthetics and drawings and I found this to be a big deal in my learning journey. Also got a little introduction to VueJS, which is slightly intimidating so definitely going to rewatch that part of the lesson.

**Thoughts:** I feel good! The tutorials didn't teach me to make my animation do the cool blinking thing so I figured it out on my own and tinkered around with the code. You always feel a lot more successful when you're making things happen on your own and learning about specific properties. I'm really liking SCSS and definitely want to learn more about it.

### Day 4: February 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I continued watching Coding Artists' tutorial on Pure CSS. VueJS is confusing as fuck so I definitely want to look into that later on. I learned about efficient ways to use CSS Animations in the ~front-end~ world which is awesome. I'm going to tinker with fun stuff for now to learn CSS proficiently so I created a template for a cat I'm going to draw with CSS. I wrote about the HTML (pug version) in CodePen and I declared my variables with SCSS.

**Thoughts:** I think VueJS is really cool and can do some powerful things. I'm thinking I'm going to continue practicing pure CSS / SCSS so I can learn what different properties are used for. I know that SCSS is used widely in the industry so it's important to learn it. I feel good! I'm nervous about drawing the cat on my own but it'll be a nice challenge to tackle.

### Day 5: February 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Watched a little bit of Coding Artist's code along of the Ninento Switch. I worked on my CSS Cat drawing but I feel like I didn't get that far. I'm still trying to understand percentages in CSS so I played around with that for a bit.

**Thoughts:** I kind of struggled today! I wasn't sure how to align the inner ears for my CSS Cat so I tinkered with the ```top``` and ```left``` percentages. I'm thinking I'm going to sit through the code along tomorrow and watch what he's trying to do and then do some code drawing lessons on Khan Academy.
