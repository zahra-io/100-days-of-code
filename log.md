# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Frontend Masters Introduction to Web Development Course. Spent two hours watching the lectures and finished the HTML lectures. It was a great refresher to JavaScript basics.

**Thoughts:** Good! I haven't touched programming in a long time + it's always nice to refresh your memory of everything. I think at this point, my knowledge is pretty good in HTML and CSS, but there's always something new I can learn.

### Day 2: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed an hour of the CSS section of Introduction to Web Development. I love CSS, it's creative and challenging and there's so much you can do with it.

**Thoughts:** I know how to use CSS and I'm aware of the rules but I really liked how the instructor explained it. He taught the VERY basic of CSS, which I haven't been able to get in some of the tutorials I've seen. So this was a nice refresher too and helped me understand some concepts differently.

### Day 3: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Watched an hour of Introduction of JavaScript Programming by Kyle Simpson on Frontend Masters. Read chapter 1 of YDKJS "Up & Going" and started Flexbox Zombies.

**Thoughts:** The course is a little bit too basic for me but I liked how the concepts were explained. I REALLY love Flexbox Zombies. I love the design, the interactivity, and the fact that you are learning by playing something awesome.

### Day 4: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Frontend Masters Introduction to JavaScript Programming by Kyle Simpson. Read Chapter 2 of YDKJS. Chapter 2 of Flexbox Zombies.

**Thoughts:** I feel good! Refreshers are always nice and since I haven't touched programming in a long time, it was nice to know that I still remember a lot of the JavaScript concepts.

### Day 5: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 3 of YDKJS "Up & Going" and continued practicing Flexbox Zombies.

**Thoughts:** Motivation was slightly low today but I finished YDKJS "Up & Going". It reintroduced a lot of the topics that I already  knew, which was great!
