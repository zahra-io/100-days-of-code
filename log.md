# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: November 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No coding but I watched an hour of CS50 on edX of week 0.

**Thoughts** This introductory course to Computer Science is so interesting. The instructor introduced a lot of topics but we're starting the first lecture/week off with Scratch. I'm SO excited. I didn't get through the entire lecture, but I'm going to continue watching the rest of it tomorrow.
