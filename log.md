# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 1: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Frontend Masters Introduction to Web Development Course. It was a great refresher to JavaScript basics.

**Thoughts:** Good! I haven't touched programming in a long time + it's always nice to refresh your memory of everything. I think at this point, my knowledge is pretty good in HTML and CSS, but there's always something new I can learn.
